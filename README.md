# Pac_Man
Project Overview:
Introduction: Pacman, one of the most iconic arcade games of all time, continues to captivate audiences with its simple yet addictive gameplay. To bring this classic game to modern platforms and enhance its functionality, we propose the development of a Pacman game utilizing Tkinter, Pygame, threading, and OS libraries. This project aims to provide an immersive gaming experience while also exploring the integration of multiple libraries and threading techniques for enhanced performance.

Objectives:
1. Implement the core mechanics of Pacman using Pygame for graphics and event handling. Used numpy as well.
2. Utilize Tkinter to create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for menu screens and choosing your Pacman.
3. Integrate threading to keep the game loop running concurrently with the main thread, allowing for better responsiveness and handling of Pygame events
4. Incorporate OS for file operations to check if a file exists before loading data from it and to save data to a file. (Used for high score tracking)
5. Implement other minute details which were given as the project prerequisites.

GUIDE:
Download all the files and start the game by running the file 'StartMenu.py.'
